This is a starter template for [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn).

Other Hosting Options

Next.js can be deployed to any hosting provider that supports Node.js.

If youâ€™ve followed the instructions so far, your package.json should have the following build and start scripts:

{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "next",
    "build": "next build",
    "start": "next start"
  }
}

In your own hosting provider, run the build script once, which builds the production application in the .next folder.

npm run build

After building, the start script starts a Node.js server that supports hybrid pages, serving both statically generated and server-side rendered pages, and API Routes.

npm run start

    Tip: You can customize the start script in package.json to accept a PORT parameter by updating it as: "start": "next start -p $PORT".
